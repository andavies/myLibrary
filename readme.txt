TODO in next version:

- add ability to request books through the site (instead of user emailing manually)
- add groups/regions so that the site can be used across different locations (see public/request.php)
- better handle isbn format returned by googlebooks api (see lookup() in includes/functions.php)
- fix bug in mybooks.php drop-down menu displaying twice when clicked twice
