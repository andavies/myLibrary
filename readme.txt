'myLibrary' - a website that allows users to share and lend books in their local community  
Originally my final project for the Harvard University course CS50 (cs50.harvard.edu)

TODO in next version:

- add ability to request books through the site (instead of user emailing manually)
- add groups/regions so that the site can be used across different locations (see public/request.php)
- some books not found on isbn search eg. "The Demolished Man 9781407239934" - why? 
- json_decode() issue. For example The Dark Tower 9780340829752 is returned correctly by API but 
  json_decode() doesn't work. Why??
- fix bug in mybooks.php drop-down menu displaying twice when clicked twice
